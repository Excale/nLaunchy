nLaunchy v2.6
=============
PLEASE READ THE WHOLE README BEFORE DOING ANYTHING.

nLaunchy is a set of programs and crafted OS updates suitable for:
* Nspire Clickpad and Touchpad calculators running boot2 1.4.1571 ("1.4");
* Nspire CX calculators running boot2 3.1.0.16 ("3.1").

It enables users to install and launch arbitrary OS updates located into the
user-accessible part of the filesystem - especially Linux :-) (see
http://tiplanet.org/nspire-linux-builds/ for more information )

As usual, use at your own risk :-P


Initial installation
====================
Needless to say, all steps are important ;-)

***** Clickpad and Touchpad installation (see below for CX) *****
-----------------------------------------------------------------
0) backup all your documents from your Nspire on your computer

1) install the 1.4.1571 boot2, usually known as "1.4". See
   http://ti-pla.net/a10080  (easiest way to do it)
   http://ti-pla.net/a3503   (use only if you cannot use the first one)
   http://ti-pla.net/a3507   (use only if you cannot use the first one)

2) get a compatible OS. See
   http://tiplanet.org/forum/archives_list.php?id=OS+Nspire
   - NOTE: Not all TI-OSes are compatible with nLaunchy (but many are).
     OSes 3.1.0.392, 3.6.0.546 and 3.9.0.46x are.
     For a full list of compatible OSes, check src/patch.c

3) use TNOC ( http://ti-pla.net/a1922 ) on the OS upgrade to remove the boot2
   (you can remove the examples too)

4) rename the TNOC'ed OS to phoenix.tns

5) transfer phoenix.tns to your calculator in the folder /nlaunch/, being at
   the root of the user-accessible part of the file-system

6) on the computer, browse to the CLASSIC folder

7) transfer nlaunch.tns to your calculator in the folder /nlaunch/, being at
   the root of the user-accessible part of the file-system

8) reboot, go to the maintenance menu ( http://ti-pla.net/t5360 ), delete OS
   (option 2 (you might have to press `t` on a touchpad calculator))

9) reboot, transfer nlaunch.tno/tnc to your calculator (an error will certainly
   be shown on the computer, check if it is ok on your calculator)
   - /!\ first boot can be fairly long (max 3 min); the progression bar can be
     quite unstable. If the bar did not move at all during 3 minutes, consider
     the boot as a failure

10) enjoy :-)


**** CX installation (see above for Clickpad and Touchpad) *****
----------------------------------------------------------------
0) backup all your documents from your Nspire on your computer

1) install the 3.1.0.16 boot2, usually known as "3.1".
   - If your current OS is older than 3.1, install OS 3.1.0.392.
   - If your current OS is between 3.1 and 3.2.3, you probably already have it.
   - If your current OS is between 3.3 and 4.0, install OS 4.0 and use
   nsNandMgr ( http://ti-pla.net/a10080 ).
   - If you have installed any newer version without TNOC-ing it, you will
   probably not be able to easily install the 3.1.0.16 boot2

2) get a compatible OS. See
   http://tiplanet.org/forum/archives_list.php?id=OS+Nspire
   - NOTE: Not all TI-OSes are compatible with nLaunchy (but many are).
     OSes 3.1.0.392, 3.6.0.546 and 4.0.3.29 are.
     For a full list of compatible OSes, check src/patch.c

3) use TNOC ( http://ti-pla.net/a1922 ) on the OS upgrade to remove the boot2
   (you can remove the examples too)

4) rename the TNOC'ed OS to phoenix.tns

5) transfer phoenix.tns to your calculator in the folder /nlaunch/, being at
   the root of the user-accessible part of the file-system

6) on the computer, browse to the CX folder

7) transfer nlaunch.tns to your calculator in the folder /nlaunch/, being at
   the root of the user-accessible part of the file-system

8) reboot (the reset button is the easiest way), go to the maintenance menu
   ( http://ti-pla.net/t5360 ), delete OS (option 2)

9) reboot, transfer nlaunch.tco/tcc to your calculator (an error will certainly
   be shown on the computer, check if it is ok on your calculator)
   - /!\ the initial exploit can fail. If the progress bar is stuck at 60% and
     nothing is shown (you should briefly see "YZ") at the top left of the
     screen, reset and send nlaunch.tco/tcc again
   - /!\ if the screen becomes very bright (white/blue color), reset and try
     again
   - /!\ getting to the OS the first time can be fairly long (max 3 min); the
     progression bar can be quite unstable. If the bar did not move at all
     during 3 minutes, consider the boot as a failure

10) enjoy :-)
   - /!\ when rebooting, the progress bar can sometimes be stuck a 60% with
     nothing shown at the top left of the screen. Simply press "reset" until it
     works


Update of the target OS version
===============================
1) get a compatible OS. See
   http://tiplanet.org/forum/archives_list.php?id=OS+Nspire

2) use TNOC ( http://ti-pla.net/a1922 ) on the OS upgrade to remove the boot2

3) rename the TNOC'ed OS to phoenix.tns

4) transfer phoenix.tns to your calculator in the folder /nlaunch/, being at
   the root of the user-accessible part of the file-system

5) reboot
   - /!\ first boot can be fairly long (max 3 min); the progression bar can be
     quite unstable

6) the old OS can now be found in nlaunch/phoenix.old.tns


Update of nLaunchy
==================
1) get to the CLASSIC or CX folder according to your calculator

2) transfer nlaunch.tns to your calculator in the folder /nlaunch/, being at
   the root of the user-accessible part of the file-system

3) reboot


Uninstallation
==============
1) get any compatible OS. See
   http://tiplanet.org/forum/archives_list.php?id=OS+Nspire

2) use TNOC ( http://ti-pla.net/a1922 ) on the OS upgrade to remove the boot2

3) reboot, go to the maintenance menu ( http://ti-pla.net/t5360 ), delete OS

4) reboot, transfer the OS to your calculator


Additional features
===================
The following keys should be pressed at boot time before PP gets printed
and released once 3 gets printed on the screen
* Pressing ESC will trigger the "Download mode", allowing you to transfer
  documents to your Nspire via USB. Reset you Nspire to quit
  /!\ This feature is broken on Nspire CX
* Pressing TAB will try to load Linux by loading
  /documents/linux/linuxloader.tns
* If it is working fine and you want nLaunchy to be more stealthy when booting,
  you can compile a quiet version ("DEBUG 1" in nlaunch.h)
* If compiled with OVERCLOCK=1:
  Will overclock your Nspire under some OSes
* If compiled with MULTIOS=1:
  Pressing the n-th key (counting from 0) of the following list:
  Clickpad: 1U2V3W+, Touchpad/CX: 1STU3VWX will, if the file exists, install
  /documents/nlaunch/phoenix_n.tns and move the current OS in the first
  available spot


Troubleshooting
===============
If you see any letter on the screen (except PP), see the Debug strings section

CX: if the reset button doesn't work, use a screwdriver to open the battery
door and remove the battery before plugging it back in


Debug strings
=============
Signification of a few debug strings:
* 'C': couldn't clean the old resources
* 'D': you are in download mode
* 'F': loading of the OS failed
* 'K': couldn't update the OS. You probably forgot to move out phoenix.old.tns
* 'U': the OS was not recognized and thus not patched


Using Ndless with nLaunch
=========================
* Ndless 1.7/2.0 should work out of the box
* Ndless 3.x/4.x: place the regular ndless_resources.tns file in
  /documents/ndless/, then reboot
